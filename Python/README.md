<ul>
  <li><a href="1.py">Given a list of ints, return True if the array contains 3 next to a 3 somewhere</a></li>
  <li><a href="2.py">Given a string, return a string where for every character in the original there are three characters</a></li>
  <li><a href="3.py">Given three integers between 1 and 11, if their sum is less than or equal to 21, return their sum. If their sum exceeds 21 and there's an eleven, reduce the total sum by 10. Finally, if the sum (even after adjustment) exceeds 21, return 'BUST'</a></li>
  <li><a href="4.py">Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and extending to the next 9 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 9). Return 0 for no numbers.</a></li>
